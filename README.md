##openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

###Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget goo.gl/OQALpo --no-check-certificate -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a little VPS for just $5/month at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f5690ec0167d) and [vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7034480).

###Tanks to Nyr for original code
